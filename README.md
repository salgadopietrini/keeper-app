# keeper-app is a clone of google Keep, created using React

This project already existed. I downloaded it to add:
Dark mode functionality, color picker and edit function. Also improved the previous delete function.

## How to use

1. Clone this repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/salgadopietrini/keeper-app.git
```

2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm start`. The command will start a local live server. Open (http://localhost:3000/) in your browser, if the tab doesn't open automatically.
